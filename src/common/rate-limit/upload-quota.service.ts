/**
 * A rolling byte budget per user, on top of the request-count limits.
 *
 * The `upload` rate tier caps how OFTEN someone uploads; it says nothing about
 * how much. 60 requests × 10 files × 20 MB is a legal way to push 12 GB in ten
 * minutes. This caps the volume.
 *
 * Deliberately complements the existing limits rather than replacing them:
 * per-file size, per-request count and request rate all still apply.
 *
 * ── Where the counters live ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * In Redis when REDIS_URL is set, so every replica spends from one budget;
 * in this process's memory otherwise, which is correct for the single replica
 * that runs today and wrong for the second one — each would grant the full
 * quota independently and the effective limit would become N × the configured
 * one. Same trade-off, and the same switch, as the rate limiter itself.
 *
 * Falling back to memory when a configured Redis cannot be reached is
 * deliberate: the alternative to a degraded limit is no limit or no uploads.
 * See RedisThrottlerStorage for the same reasoning at more length.
