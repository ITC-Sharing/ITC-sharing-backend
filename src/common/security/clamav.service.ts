/**
 * Malware scanning, via clamd over TCP.
 *
 * Everything else in the upload path answers "is this file what it claims to
 * be". This answers a different question — "is it hostile" — and nothing else
 * in the platform asks it. Signature validation stops an HTML payload wearing a
 * .jpg name; it has nothing to say about a genuine, correctly-typed PDF that
 * carries an exploit, and the whole purpose of the platform is students
 * downloading each other's files.
 *
 * ── Why the protocol is written out here ─────────────────────────────────
 * INSTREAM is four lines of framing: send `zINSTREAM\0`, then each chunk as a
 * big-endian uint32 length followed by its bytes, then a zero length to finish.
 * clamd replies with one NUL-terminated line. The npm clients wrap that in
 * either a shell-out to `clamdscan` or an unmaintained socket layer; neither is
 * worth a dependency for something this small, and the framing is pinned by
 * tests that drive a real socket.
