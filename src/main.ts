   * How many proxies sit in front, counted from this process outwards.

   * Configurable because the answer is a deployment fact, not a code one. With
   * a single backend it is 1 (cloudflared alone). Behind the nginx load
   * balancer it is 2 — cloudflared writes the real client address into
   * X-Forwarded-For, then nginx appends cloudflared's own. Trusting one hop too
   * few attributes every request to the load balancer and collapses all
   * IP-keyed limits into one bucket; one too many trusts an address the caller
   * supplied.
   *
   * The number matters, and `true` is the wrong answer even though it "works".
   * `true` trusts the entire X-Forwarded-For chain, so a caller can prepend a
   * fresh address to every request and give themselves an unlimited number of
   * rate-limit buckets. `1` takes the address nginx wrote and ignores anything
   * the caller put in front of it.
   *
   * This is also why it must match the deployment: with this set to 1 while the
   * API is exposed directly, X-Forwarded-For becomes caller-controlled and the
   * IP-keyed limits can be bypassed outright. Port 3000 is bound to 127.0.0.1
   * in docker-compose.prod.yml for that reason. See docs/rate-limiting.md.
